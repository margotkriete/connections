### Connessioni

This is a very basic spin-off of the NYT Connections game. The objective is to group the tiles into four groups of four, each group tied by a common category. This version is in Italian and, to simplify the game for learning purposes, each group is an Italian synonym generated using NLTK's wordnet package.
